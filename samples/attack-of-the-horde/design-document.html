            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>It's based on space invaders, but themed around a zombie invasion on the player's defenses. The player
                must balance attacking zombies and establishing more defenses to survive as long as possible.</p>
            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>It could be classified as an arcade style game, specifically with shooting elements.</p>
            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>It will be only be designed to function on desktop. This is because adapting the screen and play space to
                fit on a phone might impact the gameplay too much.</p>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>The premise is that the player is defending themselves and their base from an invading zombie horde. It
                will attempt to invoke feelings of action and horror while leaning into the simplicity of the aesthetic
                style to keep it casual. The player's motivation will be to attain a high score on the number of waves
                they survive.</p>
            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>The game will have a simple aesthetic with monotone black and white pixel art accentuated with occasional
                splashes of red. This will hopefully make it quick to produce and easy to read for the player.</p>
            <p>Sound will have an 8-bit feel, but not strictly adhere to actual 8-bit limitations. There will need to be
                audio clips for starting the game, shooting, creating new defenses, and the game ending. These sounds
                could be more akin to convential 8-bit. Sounds such as zombies groaning or the player being damaged
                could use heavily bitcrushed audio samples. Music may also require this technique.</p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The player can move left/right and shoot directly upwards, similar to space invaders.</li>
                <li>Zombies continually spawn from the top of the screen in waves.</li>
                <li>Zombies can be shot to kill them.</li>
                <li>The player has health. When a zombie reaches the bottom of the screen, it deals damage. When health
                    reaches zero, the game ends.</li>
                <li>The player can build barriers in front of them, which slow zombies by forcing them to attack it
                    first.</li>
                <li>The player can build explosives that kill zombies in a radius when they reach it.</li>
                <li>Building requires resources obtained by killing zombies.</li>
                <li>Some zombies shoot projectiles that can damage the player.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Control</h3>
            <p>It will only require a keyboard to play.</p>
            <h3>Onboarding</h3>
            <p>While the arcade nature of the game provides few onboarding options, something that could work is to make
                the player start the game by pressing the same button used to shoot. Thus, the game immediately begins
                as a shot is being fired into a lone zombie. This teaches the player how to shoot if they don't bother
                to read the instructions on the title screen.
            </p>
            <h3>Player Learning</h3>
            <p>The game begins with relatively few zombies and increaes in intensity over time. This gives the player a
                chance to learn before pressure is increased. The more they play the game, the better the player will
                become at intuiting when it is best to prioritize shooting over defensive construction.</p>

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>Because this project was started without a precusor assignment to learn PixiJS, much of the development
                time was spent figuring out how to use the library. I began by creating the HTML page on which the game
                would be hosted. Then, I split the program into a state machine using different Javascript files. While
                this is worse for load times, it is much more convenient for human readability. Then, I programmed each
                state as needed. Partway through, I ended up needing to manually download the bundled PixiJS libraries
                since the PixiJS Filters library was broken on the CDN version. Ultimately, this meets project
                requirements by providing a user-friendly, interactive experience which features sound, graphics, ES6
                classes, moderate responsiveness, and clean code conventions.</p>
