        <p>The creation process for this project began with the interface sketch, followed by writing the semantic HTML.
            Next, the Javascript was implemented and tested, after which CSS was added. In order to determine how to use
            the API, I followed the instructions provided on <a href="https://open5e.com/api-docs" target="_blank">this
                page</a>. Additionally, whenever I needed to know the data keys for the JSON objects, I could either
            visit <a href="https://api.open5e.com/v1/monsters/" target="_blank">this page</a> or print the returned
            object to console. It is worth noting that, while the API provides an image property in the results, very
            few monsters actually have images. This is a limitation of the API's data and is not something I can easily
            solve. This project meets the requirements by having a functional and aesthetically pleasing web page which
            can be used to search an API and display the results to the user. It displays a spinner image and results
            text
            to keep the user notified of the application's current status. It also saves the user's previous search term
            when closing the page, as per the project requirements.</p>
