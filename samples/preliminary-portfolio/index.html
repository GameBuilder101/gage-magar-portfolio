                    <p>Topping Tumble is a 2D puzzle game where the player must place tiles and contraptions in order to guide sentient ingredients into an oven. This was an academic project created in the span of a semester which based on the prompt, "you can't make me". It was developed in a team of four. My contribution to the project was in the planning phase, gameplay design, and programming the underlying structure and some gameplay systems.</p>

                <p>Beneath the Permafrost is a first-person survival-horror game set in a frozen world. This is a long-running project developed solo using the Unity engine. It has played a major role in expanding my skillset and ability to structure a large game project. Skills exercised include gameplay design/programming, UX/UI design, user playtesting, optimization, 3D art/animation, and music/sound design.</p>

                    <p>Vulgord's tower is a turn-based, tabletop RPG simulator. It was co-created alongside my father. My roles in the project were programming, gameplay design, and 3D art. This project was my introduction to the Unity engine and gave me experience in using networking APIs to handle online multiplayer through the Steam P2P system. It also served as a full exploration of the development process, from the prototyping phase to publishing.</p>
